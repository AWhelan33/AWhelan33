Footnotes:
"1","These regional totals are created by summing the Local Authroities featured in this table. The Local authority is based on the grid reference provided and some inaccuracies in the recording of the location are possible. For this reason totals shown here may not match those reported elsewhere."
"2","Since April 2009, data have been collected via the Incident Recording System (IRS). This has replaced the previous FDR paper forms and may cause an increase in the reporting of some categories of fire from 2009-10 onwards."
